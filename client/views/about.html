            <p>Have you ever prepared for an exam by doing exams from previous years? Noticed how boring it is to do
            multiple choice questions on paper or PDF, having to check the answers on another paper/PDF afterwards?</p>

            <p>Kramster helps making this a little more fun. Select your school and course and cram for your exam by doing the
            multiple choice questions with instant feedback!</p>

            <p>Can't find your course's exams on Kramster? Just send the PDFs to
            <a href="mailto:matsbyr@gmail.com">matsbyr@gmail.com</a>,
            and the small Kramster elves will add them for you.
            That's a great way to help your fellow students, don't you think?</p>
