Kramster is a quiz app for making exam preparation more fun. It works for all exams having multiple choice questions.

## API
The API has four parts: __Exams__, __Reports__, __Stats__, __List__. 
You can use the Exams part to get access to all the questions Kramster has to offer, and their answers. 
The Reports part is for getting the reports generated when a person has finished an exam. 
Use this for detailed analysis of how well the Kramster users do. 
The Stats part is for getting some standard accumulated statistics based on the reports. 
The List part is for getting a string array of names of schools, courses or exams.

Please see the [API Reference](https://github.com/draperunner/Kramster/wiki) for details on the API.
